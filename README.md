# Task Manager Web App

> Simple To-do Application

My first Java web app.

## Get started

Make sure to have all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) satisfied before starting.

### Prerequisites

* Java version 17.0.6
* Maven version 3.6.3

### Run local

Clone this repository into your local machine with `git clone https://github.com/lucas-lm/java-spring-web-todo.git`

Open it in your favorite IDE.

If you have everything setup in your local machine, you can start the application locally with:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Base URL for this application is http://localhost:8080

You can access H2 admin console at http://localhost:8080/h2-console 

H2 console credentials:
* username: admin
* password: admin

> [!NOTE]  
> As we are running an in-memmory database, the persisted data will be lost every time you reset the application.

## Endpoints

All the tasks operations, within the `/tasks/` root path, requires authentication. The authentication method follows the [basic access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) standard, where username and password must be sent through request's headers in Base64 encoding: `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`. Here the `credentials` must be generated by encoding the string `<username>:<password>`.

Table below summarize the application's endpoints.

| Path          | Method | Body              | Description                                         |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `/users/`     | `POST` | [User](#users)    | Register a new user                                 |
| `/tasks/`     | `POST` | [Task](#tasks)    | Create a new task for the authenticated user        |
| `/tasks/`     | `GET`  |                   | Show the task list of the authenticated user        |
| `/tasks/{id}` | `PUT`  | [Task](#tasks)    | Update the task of the given ID with new properties |

> [!NOTE]  
> Model's auto-generated fields are not required to be sent in the request body.
